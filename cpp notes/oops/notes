Object oriented programming

real life scenary of becomes more representable;

how to use real scenary using oops

vector , string , stake libraries were made with oops

 Classes and Objects
 1. Objects are entities in the real world 
 2. class is like a blueringt of these entities

structure--

## Access Modifier
    private: data & methods accessible inside class 
    public : data & methods accessible to everyone
    protected : data & methods inside class & to its derived class

# Pillars of oops
    1.Encapsulation
    2.Abstraction
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphism
## Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is wrapping up of data & member functions in a single unit called class.

    >> data/properties + member function  in a single unit(class)
    >> data hiding -- private


## Constructor
    >> special kind of function automatically invoked at time of object creation. Used for intialisation.
        >> same as class.
        >> constructor doesn't have a return type.
        >> Only called once (automatically), at object creation
        >> Memory allocation happens when constructor is called
        >> constructor should be in public always
    >> Non perameterized constructor
    >> Parameterized constructor
         >> there can be more than one constructor in one but every constructor should have different parameters , type also.( constructor overloading)
    >> copy constructor
        >> Special Constructor (default) used to copy properties of one object into another.
    $$ (this) is a special pointer in cpp that points to the current object.
    this -> prop is a same as *(this).prop
        # shallow & deep copy
        >> A shallow copy of an object copies all of the member values from one object to another
        >> A deep copy , on the other hand, not only copies the member of the values but also makes copies of any dynamically allocated memory that the members points to
